            <p>Welcome! My name is Magdalena, and I am an architecture student at ETH Zurich. I am currently in the 5th semester of my bachelor's degree.</p>

                <h3>Atelierhaus</h3>
                <h4>HS22, Professur Andrea Deplazes, Entwurf und Konstruktion I (1st Semester)</h4>
                   <p>The concept behind this studio house is based on the dialectic of intro- and extroversion. This house is suitable for someone that works independently from others while still enjoying social interactions during their free time.</p>
 
<p>In this case, the workplace is set in the center of a private garden that is surrounded by covered walkways. This cloister like garden creates a distraction free space and allows for greater productivity and focus.</p>
 
<p>The living space on the other hand, consists of four peripherally arranged spaces. These are connected by long corridors that serve the purpose of bringing more movement into everyday life. This is especially important in the case of a studio house, because the bringing together of living and working suggests that the inhabitant doesnâ€™t need to leave the house very often and thus, would lack physical activity.</p>
 
<p>In order to emphasize the decoupling of working and living, both are located on two different floor levels. This separation also illustrates the concept of introversion and extroversion very well. Furthermore, a clear hierarchy can be seen from the height difference between the living or working spaces and the corridors.</p>
